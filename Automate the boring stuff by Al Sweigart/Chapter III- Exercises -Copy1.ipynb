    "\n",
    "- Here are the improvements and explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "The import sys statement isn't used in this program, so it can be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the collatz function, we can use else instead of elif number % 2 == 1 because if a number is not even, it must be odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "The try-except block should encompass both the input and the while loop. \n",
    "This way, it catches ValueError for both the initial input and any potential errors during the sequence calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert the input to an integer immediately using int(input(...)). This ensures n is always an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop should be inside the try block to handle potential errors during the sequence calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remove the last line collatz(number) as it's not needed and would cause an error (number is not defined).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your original implementation was very close! The main issues were with error handling and the placement of the while loop. The core logic of the Collatz sequence was correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, it's normal to encounter errors when programming. The process of debugging and improving your code is an essential part of learning. Great job on getting this far on your own!\n",
    "\n",
    "The main program logic is contained within the try-except block, which handles the input and the Collatz sequence calculation. \n"
