    "Variable Initialization:\n",
    "Always initialize variables before using them. Assign values to variables after they have been defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation:\n",
    "Python uses indentation to define code blocks. Ensure that if, elif, and else statements are properly aligned, and the code within each block is consistently indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "String Literals:\n",
    "Ensure that string literals are enclosed with matching quotation marks (either single ' ' or double \" \" quotes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional Logic:\n",
    "Use if-elif-else chains to handle mutually exclusive conditions. This ensures that only one block of code runs for a given condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax and Readability:\n",
    "Pay attention to syntax errors, such as mismatched quotes or missing colons, which can prevent your code from running.\n",
    "Write clear and readable code by following Python's conventions and best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing and Debugging:\n",

    "The standard practice is to use 4 spaces for each indentation level.\n",

    "Block Definition:\n",
    "Indentation starts a new block after statements that end with a colon (:), such as if, for, while, def, and class.\n",

    "Alignment:\n",
    "All lines of code in the same block must be aligned at the same indentation level.\n",
